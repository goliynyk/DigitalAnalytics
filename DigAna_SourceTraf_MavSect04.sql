-- Traffic Source Analysis (part 1) 5 assignments -Email, Social, Search, Direct (Mktg Director type questions)

-- -- -- -- and adjusting bids to optimize marketing budgets (answer â€“ gmail, non br)

-- ANSWER: traffic was negatively impacted, volume down, now need to make up volume in other campaigns that have better CR rate
